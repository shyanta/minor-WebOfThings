# Explain this

## Introduction
A few years ago we were able to connect devices from the same manufacture and we called it Internet of Things (IoT). IoT had limitations since devices could only connect if they had the same manufacturer and weren't able to connect to other devices while the name suggests otherwise. As a reaction the term Web of Things was created, the name mocking IoT. Using the web every device could connect. In this project we explore the possibilities of the Web of Things.

To be able to connect devices together inside our project we used a few fundamentals. We used a button, a NeoPixel, the ESP8266 (a microcontroller), Arduino IDE (software to write code and upload it to the hardware) and a server-sided webpage to send and receive colors to and from people using the web. On the server-sided webpage you can setup a color and choose the recipiant to send it to. If the button is pressed the color will be send to the chosen recipiant. The NeoPixel of the recipiant outputs the received color. With the above-mentioned elements we came up with a concept that would help us in our everyday life (you can read about the concept in 'About').

In this read me we will explain how we made our product and how you can build it yourself.
