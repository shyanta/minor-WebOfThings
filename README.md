## About
The concept we came up with, can be used with classes and lectures.
The general idea is, that during the lecture, a student can press the button if they don't
understand it. The teacher has a lightbox on his table. The more the button is pressed, the color
of the lightbox will change from green to red.

You can apply this color change on the click events. So when the button is pressed 2 times,
the green color will change to yellow. The following 2 times yellow will change to orange. After that
it will change to red. When 6 or more students have pressed their button, the lightbox will have a
bright red color. This will hint the teacher, that what he is explaining, is to difficult and will need
more time to explain.

This way students won't have to interrupt the presentation but can simply press the button, to give
the teacher fast and visual feedback.
